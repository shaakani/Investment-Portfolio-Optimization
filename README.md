## 🧠 Project Overview

This research project explores the integration of **Environmental, Social, and Governance (ESG)** factors into investment portfolio optimization using **advanced machine learning algorithms**. The study investigates how ESG-based strategies can balance **financial performance** and **sustainability goals**.

By applying models like **LSTM**, **SVM**, and **Heuristic Optimization**, we evaluate the financial viability and ethical effectiveness of ESG-integrated portfolios — and compare them against traditional investment strategies such as **Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)**.

## 💡 Key Highlights

- 📊 **Sharpe Ratio of ESG Portfolio**: 0.538  
- 📉 **Volatility**: Comparable to non-ESG portfolios  
- ✅ **Statistical Validity**: Confirmed through backtesting and t-tests  
- 🔍 **Social factors** showed the best balance of return and sustainability

---

## 🎯 Objectives

- Optimize investment portfolios using machine learning with and without ESG integration
- Compare ESG portfolios with traditional financial portfolios
- Identify the most effective ML technique for ESG-based portfolio optimization
- Quantify trade-offs between sustainability and profitability

---

## 🧰 Tools & Technologies

- **Programming Language**: Python  
- **ML Libraries**: TensorFlow/Keras, Scikit-learn  
- **Optimization**: Differential Evolution (SciPy), MVO  
- **Data Sources**: Yahoo Finance, Kaggle ESG datasets  
- **Preprocessing**: Pandas, NumPy, MinMaxScaler, StandardScaler  
- **Visualization**: Matplotlib, Seaborn  
- **Statistical Testing**: t-tests for hypothesis validation  
- **Framework**: CRISP-DM for structured data science workflow

## 🧪 Machine Learning Models

### 🔁 Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM)
- Captured temporal financial patterns with highest return and Sharpe ratio
- Hyperparameter-tuned using Grid Search

### 🧮 Support Vector Machines (SVM)
- Applied for both regression and ESG classification
- Performed moderately well but less effective than LSTM for time-series prediction

### 🧠 Heuristic Optimization
- Balanced ESG compliance and financial return
- Tuned penalty factors for ESG integration into objective function

### 📊 Mean-Variance Optimization (MVO)
- Used as a benchmark model for non-ESG strategies

## 📈 Evaluation Metrics

- **Financial Metrics**: Sharpe Ratio, Return, Volatility, Max Drawdown  
- **ML Metrics**: MAE, MSE, R², Accuracy, F1 Score  
- **Backtesting**: Rolling window strategy  
- **ESG Penalty Tuning**: For measuring trade-offs

---

## 🏆 Key Takeaways

- ESG-integrated portfolios **achieved comparable financial results** to non-ESG portfolios, making a strong case for **responsible investing**.
- **LSTM models outperformed** traditional and heuristic methods, offering best returns but with higher volatility.
- **Social factors** were most effective among ESG dimensions in achieving risk-adjusted returns.
- Heuristic optimization provided **interpretable, efficient, and ethically aligned** portfolio strategies.

---

## 📘 Future Enhancements

- Introduce **dynamic ESG penalty factors**
- Explore **transformer-based architectures**
- Integrate **alternative sustainability metrics** like carbon footprint
- Broaden dataset coverage across multiple financial markets
